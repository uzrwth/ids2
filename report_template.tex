     \section*{Statement on the usage of LLMs}
     \textlangle If you make use of generative AI in the form of LLMs, state in which tasks you used them for which purpose.
     You may also further argue why the specific usage does not detract from your understanding of a particular task. \textrangle

    	\subsection{a}
\inputminted[fontsize=\tiny]{python}{ distributed_data_processing/best_movies.py  }

\csvautotabular[respect all]{ top8.csv  }

There are 8 records in the csv file, but the latex csvsimple package doesn't work well with csv files with special characters such as ",", and it only shows 5 records here. The full records can be seen in the top8.csv file.

    	\subsection{b}
\inputminted[fontsize=\tiny]{python}{ distributed_data_processing/haters.py  }

          \subsection{c}
          Before handing the outputs of mappers to reducers, the combiners intercept the pairs and combine the counts of reviews with the same key, though in the sense of grouping in subsets. This reduces the communication overhead that is sent to the reducers. The best-case scenario is when the combiners get the similar workloads, so that with the parallel processing, no combiners is processing too much data.
